            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>At the moment I live and work in Cologne, but I love
                to work remotely and am looking for new challenges: Give me bad conversion rates, dropouts, boring
                texts, and unsatisfied customers. Hire me to optimize your website, shop, app, or service in German and
                English.</p>
            <p>My heart belongs to creating satisfactory customer stories - with words. I have experience in writing
                copy of various lengths for different target groups, customers, and requirements. My specialties are
                Microcopy and telling stories: Sometimes the center of attention is just one word, next time I lay out a
                whole story for you.</p>
            <p>I design digital concepts for websites, apps, and interfaces as well as analog concepts for brand
                experience and corporate identity.</p>
            <p>The focus of my texts and concepts is always on the optimal user experience - from conception and
                planning to storytelling and the creation of pleasing, unique, and consistent content in text and
                visuals.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="container">
            <h2>Why do you need an optimized copy?</h2>
            <p>I like to imagine the copy of your website as a person’s voice - a really skilled person’s voice - your
                best customer advisor, your employee of the year. She welcomes customers at the entrance, guides them
                through the website, provides advice, and anticipates the customer’s questions so that they can be
                answered immediately. As a real sales talent, she knows a lot about psychology, so she can even
                predict your customer’s wishes and control their thoughts and actions. She found her voice and with
                skill, persuasion, and gentle pressure in the right places, she brings the deal to a close.</p>
            <p>My job is to find this voice, define the tonality, and place the words and sentences exactly where they
                have the greatest possible effect.
